After devoting the last five years to enhancing my skills in a tech manufacturing company, my passion for technology evolved, leading me to pivot from hardware to software. As I near the completion of a comprehensive software development course at Makers Academy, I am eager to embark on a career as a junior developer and further embrace this journey of continuous learning.

## Skills

#### Communication

Communication is a skill that I've cultivated significantly over the years at Carallon. I've spent ample time engaging with suppliers, customers, and colleagues from various departments. When I worked in the operations department, I would be on the phone weekly to customs, explaining what the products were and about the certification we had, this would ensure it would get to the customers without any trouble. This experience has not only bolstered my confidence but also equipped me to adeptly handle issues as they arise.

I particularly excel in one-on-one interactions, where I can establish deeper connections and foster relationships that enhance team efficiency and make work more enjoyable. I believe these interpersonal skills will seamlessly complement pair programming, a practice I've come to thoroughly appreciate. Pair programming facilitates knowledge sharing, and much of my learning during my time at Makers Academy has occurred during these sessions. Not only have I gained new insights from my peers, but I've also solidified my own understanding by teaching concepts.


#### Problem Solving

Every day, I find myself immersed in problem-solving, and I genuinely relish the experience. During my time at Carallon, this was a common occurrence, especially during product testing when I had to integrate software into our products. It was up to me to use my skills and experience to identify the issues and fix them effectively. During the final stages of testing, I noticed a few processors were working but were occasionally loses video. I took some time to investigate it and found that one of our parts had a new supplier and this caused this issue only when this part was paired with our older chips. I took this to my manager and avoided a potential product recall. 

This knack for problem-solving seamlessly carries over into my passion for software development. There's something truly gratifying about the debugging process, where I break down complex issues, uncover their core, and engineer solutions. It‚Äôs a challenge which suits my calm and strategic approach, and significant part of what drew me into the world of software development.


#### Teaching

Developed strong teaching and communication skills during a three-month volunteer project with the International Citizen Service (ICS) in Nepal. Collaborated with a diverse team of Nepali citizens to enhance education and community engagement. Conducted classroom teaching for students in years 7 to 9, emphasizing English language instruction. Initiated morning classes for adult learners in the community, provided personal math tutoring, and established a chess club. These skills enhance my ability to explain complex technical concepts and collaborate effectively as a software developer, bridging the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

#### Adaptability

Demonstrated adaptability and a composed manner throughout my tenure at Carallon. Managed unexpected changes in project scope and shifting client requirements with ease, including challenges posed by supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ensured timely project delivery by swiftly adapting to evolving circumstances. This adaptability and my ability to stay calm under pressure were essential in resolving critical issues, including those exacerbated by the pandemic, and maintaining client satisfaction. These attributes continue to be instrumental in my software development career, where I readily embrace new technologies and navigate demanding deadlines with composure, ensuring consistent high-quality outcomes.
